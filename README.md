# Untouchable Numbers

Simple app to either check whether a number is untouchable or return a list of untouchable numbers from a given range.

## What is an untouchable number?
An untouchable number is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of all the proper divisors of any positive integer (including the untouchable number itself). 

## Why create this code?
I was unaware of untouchable numbers, until this term was used during a riddle competition we had at work. I couldn't find any examples how to check if a number is untouchable using C#, so I thought I will give it a go.
